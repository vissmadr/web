Personal website project.

## TODO

- [ ] **Input**: The input system for each creative canvas currently sucks. Figure out how to cleanup, or use a singleton pattern.
- [ ] **Mobile**: Some of the creative canvases don't work well on mobile because of the input limitations there.
- [ ] **Loading**: Better loading for assets. Somehow lazy-preload the ones used for creative stuff.
